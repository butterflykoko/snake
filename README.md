**Snake🐍**

Hi there! This is a snake game made using mainly Typescript and Javascript. Note that in the scripts folder, there's a file called *server.js,* it's a basic script that allows the snake game to run on a local server. That file isn't necessary to run the game since the game can run in the browser.
